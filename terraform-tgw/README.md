# Deployment of FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) on the AWS with GWLB integration and Transit Gateway
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM on AWS with Gateway Load Balancer intergration.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider AWS >= 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* FOS Version >= 6.4.4

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
* 3 AWS VPCs
  - Customer VPC with 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets split two different AZs
    - 1 Internet Gateway
    - 1 Route table with edge association with Internet Gateway, and 2 internal routes with target to Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint.
    - 1 Route table with private subnet association, 1 default route with target to Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint, and 1 route with target to transit gateway.
    - 1 Route table with public subnet association, and default route with target to Internet Gateway.
  - Customer2 VPC with 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets split two different AZs
    - 1 Internet Gateway
    - 1 Route table with edge association with Internet Gateway, and 2 internal route with target to Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint.
    - 1 Route table with private subnet association, 1 default route with target to Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint, and 1 route with target to transit gateway.
    - 1 Route table with public subnet association, and default route with target to Internet Gateway.
  - FGT VPC with 1 public, 1 private, 1 gwlb, and 1 transit gateway subnet in one AZ.  And, have two different AZs. 
      - 1 Internet Gateway
      - 1 Route table with private subnet association.
      - 1 Route table with public subnet association, 1 default route with target to Internet Gateway, 2 customer vpc destinations route with target to Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint.
      - 1 Route table with gwlb subnet association, and 2 customer vpc destination route with target to transit gateway.
      - 1 Route table with transit gateway subnet association, and 1 default with with target to Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint.
  - One FortiGate-VM instance with 2 NICs : port1 on public subnet and port2 on private subnet in one AZ, and another one in different AZ.
    - port2 will be in its own FG-traffic vdom.
    - A geneve interface will be created base on port2 during bootstrap and this will be the interface where traffic will received from the Gateway Load Balancer.
  - Two Network Security Group rules: one for external, one for internal.
  - One Gateway Load Balancer with targets to FortiGates in each AZ.


## Topology overview
* Customer VPC (20.1.0.0/16)
  - public-az1   (20.1.0.0/24)
  - private-az1  (20.1.1.0/24)
  - public-az2   (20.1.2.0/24)
  - private-az2  (20.1.3.0/24)
* Customer 2 VPC (30.1.0.0/16)
  - public-az1   (30.1.0.0/24)
  - private-az1  (30.1.1.0/24)
  - public-az2   (30.1.2.0/24)
  - private-az2  (30.1.3.0/24)
* FortiGate Security VPC (10.1.0.0/16)
  - public-az1   (10.1.0.0/24)
  - private-az1  (10.1.1.0/24)
  - transit-az1  (10.1.2.0/24)
  - gwlb-az1     (10.1.3.0/24)
  - public-az2   (10.1.4.0/24)
  - private-az2  (10.1.5.0/24)
  - transit-az2  (10.1.6.0/24)
  - gwlb-az2     (10.1.7.0/24)

FortiGate VM(s) are deployed in Security VPC on both public and private subnet in different AZs.
Server(s) are deployed in the private subnet in the Customer VPC and Customer 2 VPC in different AZs

Ingress traffic to the Server(s) located in the private subnet in Customer VPC/Customer 2 VPC will be routed to GWLB, redirect to FortiGate-VM's geneve interface and send back out to GWLB endpoint.
Egress traffic from the Server(s) located in the private subnet in Customer VPC/Customer 2 VPC will be routed to GWLB and redirect to FortiGate-VM's geneve interface and send back out to GWLB endpoint.
East/West traffic to each Customer VPC will be routed to transit gateway, and to GWLB, redirected to FortiGate-VM's geneve interface, and then back out and to the destinated VPC.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM(s) to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

CustomerVPC = <Customer VPC>
FGT1-Password = <FGT 1 Password>
FGT2-Password = <FGT 2 Password>
FGT2PublicIP = <FGT 2 Public IP>
FGTPublicIP = <FGT 1 Public IP>
FGTVPC = <FGT Security VPC>
LoadBalancerPrivateIP = <Private Load Balancer IP>
LoadBalancerPrivateIP2 = <Private Load Balancer IP>
Username = <FGT Username>

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
